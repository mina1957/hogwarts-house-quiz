**Do you ever feel like you belong in more than one house? Do you ever wish that there were "combo" houses? Well, my friend, your wish just came true!**

Find Your Blended Hogwarts House is a magical React application that sorts you into your blended/combo Hogwarts house based on your responses to a series of enchanting questions. It's time to discover which unique combination of houses truly represents your wizarding spirit!

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Features

- 10 thought-provoking questions straight from the world of Harry Potter
- Magical UI with smooth transitions between questions (no Time-Turners required!)
- Calculates your personalized blended house result
- Displays custom icons for each Hogwarts house (no artistic skills from the Fat Lady needed)
- Responsive design suitable for all magical devices, from Muggle smartphones to enchanted tablets

## üß™ Potions Used (Technologies)

- React (because even wizards need to keep up with Muggle technology)
- TypeScript (for when your code needs to be as precise as a Wit-Sharpening Potion)
- Tailwind CSS (for styling as flexible as Gilderoy Lockhart's memory)
- Radix UI (for components as accessible as the Room of Requirement)
